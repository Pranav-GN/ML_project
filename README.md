Implementation of Naive Bayes(Mainly categorical) on lung cancer data-set to predict risk of lung cancer
Have implemented Categorical NB from scratch and compared results with sklearn library, i have used this NB only because the data set does not follow a normal distribution hence using gaussian NB doesnt make complete sense.
Since this is a multi-class classification, categorical data distribution is assumed, hence categorical NB works best.
To prove gaussian does not make sense, i have also implemented gaussian NB and compared results.

Additionally i have added plots to show distribution of each feature and done a scatter plot between every 2 features just to show the correlation, as it is categorical data, not much inference can be seen from the plots.
